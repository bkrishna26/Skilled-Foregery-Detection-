# Skilled-Foregery-Detection-

**Overview**

This project focuses on detecting forged handwritten signatures using deep learning techniques. The system is designed to differentiate between genuine and forged signatures by leveraging machine learning models trained on multilingual signature datasets.

**Features**

Signature Verification: Uses deep learning to classify signatures as genuine or forged.

Triplet Loss Function: Enhances the model's ability to distinguish between original and forged signatures.

RMSprop Optimization: Ensures stable training and faster convergence.

Multilingual Support: Works with datasets containing signatures in multiple languages.

PDF/Image Extraction: Automatically extracts signatures from PDFs and images for verification.
